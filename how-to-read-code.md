How To Read Source Code
=======================

---

What do we mean when we say "reading source code"?

Reading for comprehension

Reading for errors

Reading for interactions

---

Kinds of source code

* C++
* Javascript
* Shell Script
* Your favorite language here

---

Another way to think of kinds of source code

* Algorithmic
* Interface-defining
* Implementation
* Glue
* Configuring
* Tasking

^ There's a lot of study of algorithmic source code out there because that's what academia produces: algorithms, the little, often mathematical ways of doing things. All the others are a lot more nebulous but I think a lot more interesting. They're certainly the bulk of what most people write when they're programming computers.

^ Of course, sometimes, a bit of code does more than one of these things.

What's 'Glue'?

^ Not all the interfaces we want to use play nice together. Glue is the plumbing connecting things together. Middleware, promises vs callbacks binding code, inflating arguments into objects or breaking objects apart. All that's glue.
